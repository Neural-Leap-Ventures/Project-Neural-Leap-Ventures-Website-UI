      <div class="text-block-18">III. Identifying Your Specific AI Needs</div>
      <div class="text-block-19">Incorporating artificial intelligence into your business requires a deep understanding of your company&#x27;s unique needs. One effective way to identify these needs is by using the &#x27;Jobs to be Done&#x27; framework. This method emphasizes focusing on the task that needs to be completed, rather than the specific tool or solution. This approach can be particularly beneficial when thinking about AI, as it helps you pinpoint the exact processes and tasks where AI could bring about efficiency and innovation.<br><br>For example, if a critical &#x27;job to be done&#x27; in your business is analyzing large volumes of data to extract insights, an AI engineer proficient in machine learning algorithms might be needed. Alternatively, if your company needs to streamline customer service operations, an AI engineer with experience in developing chatbots could be the ideal fit. Essentially, the first step towards hiring an AI engineer should be mapping out your business processes, identifying the jobs to be done, and then understanding how AI could help perform these tasks more efficiently.<br><br>Lastly, it&#x27;s important to understand the nuances between different roles within the AI field. Not all AI professionals have the same skills or focus areas. An AI engineer typically focuses on designing and implementing AI models, while a Machine Learning engineer may specialize in programming machines to perform specific tasks. Data scientists, on the other hand, often concentrate on interpreting and analyzing complex data sets. Recognizing these distinctions is crucial in ensuring you hire the right professional for the jobs that need to be done in your organization.</div>
      <div class="text-block-18">IV. Strategies to Source AI Engineers</div>
